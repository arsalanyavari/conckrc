# conckrc

.conkyrc is my conky config file 
also i put my .dialogrc file to config dialog in script.sh
script.sh is a shell script installer to use my conky config

if you want change atributes of configs you must change the file in ~/.conkyrc
and the resources that i used in my config file are in ~/.conky/pic

have a nice time :))
